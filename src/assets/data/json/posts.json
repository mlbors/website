It is not about aesthetic. Design is first of all a working method where you have to deeply understand the users that your product will meet. For me it doesn’t matter if your product is real or virtual. You have to know precisely your goal, your destination, and to know that, you have to know even better your starting point. It is like in real life: to reach your destination, you have to know from where you come from. That way, you will never get lost."
