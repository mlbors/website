But I have never stopped learning and I really appreciate discovering new things. Some say I am self-taught.",

It is not about aesthetic. Design is first of all a working method where you have to deeply understand the users that your product will meet. For me it doesn’t matter if your product is real or virtual. You have to know precisely your goal, your destination, and to know that, you have to know even better your starting point. It is like in real life: to reach your destination, you have to know from where you come from. That way, you will never get lost."

And if you want to talk with me, I speak French, English and a little bit of Hungarian (csak egy kicsit magyarul beszélek). I am a big fan of The Beatles and Depeche Mode and I also like jazz. The adventures of Mario and Link were a part of my childhood and as an adult, I like to play video games for just a few hours a week. I like Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Jules Verne and J.R.R. Tolkien."
